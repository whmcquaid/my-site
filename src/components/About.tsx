            Hello, my name is William and I am a full stack Developer. I love to
            learn and I am passionate about coding. Right now, I work a
            full-time job cleaning, and repairing pools. Given the opportunity,
            I would love to work with a team of developers in a collaborative
            manner. When I was in middle school I created my own guild website
            for my favorite game, diablo, by teaching myself html. I also
            learned some visual basic and turbo pascal. From then on I knew I
            wanted to be in software development. For too long I gave up on that
            dream. A little more than one year ago I began self-study on The
            Odin Project, relearning this web thing. It's grown up quite a lot.
            In this process I have grown to love tackling challenges with code.
            In my experience this is best done as a team. If you would like to
            reach out please contact me.
